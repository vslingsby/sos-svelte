  subtitle: "Also Called: The Solar Realm, The Sunlit Realm, The White Ziggurat",
  description: `A red field stretching eternally beneath the burning Sun above. A ziggurat, ever-constructing, labored upon by spectral hands. There are tools laying about, and ample materials for a contribution. Above, the Sun watches, silently. No, not silently. His voice is the dry heat.`,
  special: `You regain 1 Pull per hour you spend in direct sunlight while performing some productive activity, like construction, battle, or farming.`
